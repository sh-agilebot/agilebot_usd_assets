## Project Overview

This repository contains USD (Universal Scene Description) digital assets for Agilebot Robotics' robot products, primarily targeting the **NVIDIA Isaac Sim and Isaac Lab** ecosystems for robot modeling, physics simulation, algorithm validation, and application development.

USD is an open standard for complex 3D scenes, supporting efficient hierarchical organization, composition, variants, physics, and semantic extensions. Through USD format, these robot models can be directly used in Isaac Sim, Isaac Lab, and Omniverse-related toolchains, with flexible component configuration and extension capabilities.

## Gripper Configuration and Variant Switching

Each robot model provides **Robotiq 2F-140 gripper variant**, integrated as a USD VariantSet, allowing dynamic switching without modifying the USD structure.

### Gripper Variant List

| Robot Model | Gripper Variant | File Path |
|------------|----------|----------|
| GBT-C5A | robotiq_2f_140 | `gbt-c5a/Gripper/robotiq_2f_140.usd` |
| GBT-C7A | robotiq_2f_140 | `gbt-c7a/Gripper/robotiq_2f_140.usd` |
| GBT-C12A | robotiq_2f_140 | `gbt-c12a/Gripper/robotiq_2f_140.usd` |
| GBT-C16A | robotiq_2f_140 | `gbt-c16a/Gripper/robotiq_2f_140.usd` |

### Switch Gripper Variant via Python API

In Isaac Sim / Isaac Lab, you can dynamically switch gripper configurations using the USD Python API:

```python
# Enable Robotiq 2F-140 gripper
robot.GetVariantSet("Gripper").SetVariantSelection("robotiq_2f_140")

# No gripper (bare flange)
robot.GetVariantSet("Gripper").SetVariantSelection("None")
```

This method is suitable for:

* End-effector switching for different tasks
* Quick comparison testing of grippers/tools
* Automated configuration in reinforcement learning or batch simulations

## Gripper Model Source

The gripper model is sourced from the open-source project:
[robotiq_2f_gripper](https://github.com/gen-robot/robotiq_2f_gripper/tree/main/robotiq_2f_140_gripper_visualization)

This model is for simulation and demonstration purposes only, and its copyright belongs to the original author.

Gripper import and assembly process refers to NVIDIA official documentation:
[Isaac Sim Robot Import and Assembly Tutorial](https://docs.isaacsim.omniverse.nvidia.com/latest/robot_setup_tutorials/tutorial_import_assemble_manipulator.html)

## Usage

### Using in Isaac Sim

The current version provides standardized USD asset files, which can be directly loaded via Isaac Sim's USD Loader or Reference method. Complete sample projects for Isaac Sim will be provided in future releases.

### Using in Isaac Lab

The current version can be used as input for `Articulation` or custom assets in Isaac Lab. Task configurations and examples will be released separately.

## Physics Parameters Notice

**Important Note on Physics Parameters:**

For all robot models except GBT-C5A, the physics parameters (joint damping, stiffness, mass, and directional inertia) are automatically generated by SolidWorks or Isaac Sim. Only GBT-C5A's physics parameters are derived from Agilebot's internal calculations.

Please manually adjust these parameters according to your specific simulation requirements to ensure accurate behavior.
