## 📖 Repository Overview

This repository is the core asset repository for the official Agilebot Isaac ecosystem, containing USD (Universal Scene Description) digital assets for the full range of Agilebot collaborative robots. It primarily targets the **NVIDIA Isaac Sim and Isaac Lab** ecosystems for robot modeling, physics simulation, algorithm validation, and application development.

### Core Value

- **Standardized Assets**: All robot models are in USD format, supporting seamless integration across platforms and tools
- **Physics Optimized**: Pre-configured joint natural frequencies and damping parameters ensure simulation stability and accuracy
- **Variant Support**: Built-in gripper variants for dynamic end-effector configuration switching
- **Ready to Use**: No additional configuration required, directly load and use in Isaac Sim and Isaac Lab

USD is an open standard for complex 3D scenes, supporting efficient hierarchical organization, composition, variants, physics, and semantic extensions. Through USD format, these robot models can be directly used in Isaac Sim, Isaac Lab, and Omniverse-related toolchains, with flexible component configuration and extension capabilities.

## 🔧 Gripper Configuration and Variant Switching

Each robot model provides **Robotiq 2F-140 gripper variant**, integrated as a USD VariantSet, allowing dynamic switching without modifying the USD structure.

### Gripper Variant List

| Robot Model | Gripper Variant | File Path |
|------------|----------|----------|
| GBT-C5A | robotiq_2f_140 | `gbt-c5a/Gripper/robotiq_2f_140.usd` |
| GBT-C7A | robotiq_2f_140 | `gbt-c7a/Gripper/robotiq_2f_140.usd` |
| GBT-C12A | robotiq_2f_140 | `gbt-c12a/Gripper/robotiq_2f_140.usd` |
| GBT-C16A | robotiq_2f_140 | `gbt-c16a/Gripper/robotiq_2f_140.usd` |

### Switch Gripper Variant via Python API

In Isaac Sim / Isaac Lab, you can dynamically switch gripper configurations using the USD Python API:

```python
# Enable Robotiq 2F-140 gripper
robot.GetVariantSet("Gripper").SetVariantSelection("robotiq_2f_140")

# No gripper (bare flange)
robot.GetVariantSet("Gripper").SetVariantSelection("None")
```

This method is suitable for:

* End-effector switching for different tasks
* Quick comparison testing of grippers/tools
* Automated configuration in reinforcement learning or batch simulations

## 💡 Tips

### Gripper Grasping Issues

If you experience **gripper clipping through objects or dropping** during grasping operations, try the following adjustments:

1. **Reduce gripper max force**: Lower the maximum force to single-digit values (e.g., 1-5 N) to reduce the gripping strength
2. **Significantly reduce physics simulation frame rate**: Lower the physics simulation frame rate to the default 60 FPS to reduce computational burden
    ```
    world = World(stage_units_in_meters=1.0, physics_dt=1/60.0)
    ```

These adjustments help prevent the gripper from applying excessive force that causes object penetration, but they may introduce other grasping issues. Please adjust dynamically based on your usage scenario.

## 📦 Gripper Model Source

The gripper model is sourced from the open-source project:
[robotiq_2f_gripper](https://github.com/gen-robot/robotiq_2f_gripper/tree/main/robotiq_2f_140_gripper_visualization)

This model is for simulation and demonstration purposes only, and its copyright belongs to the original author.

Gripper import and assembly process refers to NVIDIA official documentation:

## 🚀 Usage

### Using in Isaac Sim

The current version provides standardized USD asset files, which can be directly loaded via Isaac Sim's USD Loader or Reference method. Complete sample projects for Isaac Sim will be provided in future releases.

## ⚠️ Physics Parameters Notice

**Important Note on Physics Parameters:**

For all robot models, the joint natural frequency and damping parameters have been configured with Isaac Sim recommended empirical values:

- **Active Joints**: Natural frequency = 300, Damping = 0.005
- **Linked Joints**: Natural frequency = 2500, Damping = 0.005

These values are based on Isaac Sim official recommendations and have been tested to reduce issues like robot flying or shaking during simulation.

Regarding mass and directional inertia:
- **GBT-C5A**: Manually calculated by Agilebot
- **Other Models (GBT-C7A, GBT-C12A, GBT-C16A)**: Automatically generated by SolidWorks or Isaac Sim

Please manually adjust these parameters according to your specific simulation requirements to ensure accurate behavior.
