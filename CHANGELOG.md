### Optimized
- Updated all robot models' joint natural frequency and damping parameters to Isaac Sim official recommended empirical values (active joints: 300, linked joints: 2500, damping: 0.005)
- Updated physics parameters for all robot models (GBT-C5A, GBT-C7A, GBT-C12A, GBT-C16A), including mass, inertia, and joint drive parameters
- Updated physics parameters documentation to clarify mass and directional inertia sources (all models: manually calculated by Agilebot)

### Documentation
- Enhanced README with detailed integrated model information
- Added integrated model README with component specifications, usage guide, and Python API examples
- Added third-party licenses documentation with complete license information for all third-party components
- Updated physics parameters notice to reflect accurate configuration across all robot models

### Fixed
- Fixed formatting issues in CHANGELOG (removed line breaks in Optimized section)

## [0.0.3] - 2026-02-03

### Fixed
- Fixed texture loss issue for gbt-c5a_camera_gripper model

---

## [0.0.4] - 2026-03-09

### Removed
- **Removed Robotiq 2F-140 gripper USD assets** - Due to copyright uncertainty, removed all Robotiq 2F-140 gripper related USD files from all robot models (GBT-C5A, GBT-C7A, GBT-C12A, GBT-C16A)
- **Removed gbt-c5a_camera_gripper integrated model** - Removed the integrated model directory containing Robot gripper and Orbbec Femto Mega camera due to third-party copyright concerns

### Added
- Added gripper grasping troubleshooting documentation (`docs/gripper_troubleshooting_zh.md`) with systematic diagnosis steps for Isaac Sim 5.1

### Changed
- Updated all robot model main USD files to remove gripper variant references
- Updated README_zh.md to remove Robotiq gripper references and related documentation
